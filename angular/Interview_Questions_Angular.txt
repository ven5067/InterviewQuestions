5. Angular offers two ways to compile your application, what are those?
A.  1) Just-in-Time (JIT), which compiles your app in the browser at runtime.
    2) Ahead-of-Time (AOT), which compiles your app at build time.

6. What is the default compilation when you run the ng build (build only) or ng serve (build and serve locally)?
A. JIT compilation

7. How can we tell angular to compile using AOT?
A. For AOT compilation, include the --aot option with the ng build or ng serve command
   ng build --aot
   ng server --aot

8. Which compilation the angular use ydefault when we run a ng build using option prod( ng build --prod)?
A. AOT Compilation.

9. Why compile with AOT?
A. Faster rendering:
With AOT, the browser downloads a pre-compiled version of the application. The browser loads executable code so it can render the application immediately, without waiting to compile the app first.

Fewer asynchronous requests:
The compiler inlines external HTML templates and CSS style sheets within the application JavaScript, eliminating separate ajax requests for those source files.
Smaller Angular framework download size
There's no need to download the Angular compiler if the app is already compiled. The compiler is roughly half of Angular itself, so omitting it dramatically reduces the application payload.
Detect template errors earlier
The AOT compiler detects and reports template binding errors during the build step before users can see them.

Better security:
AOT compiles HTML templates and components into JavaScript files long before they are served to the client. With no templates to read and no risky client-side HTML or JavaScript evaluation, there are fewer opportunities for injection attacks.

10. How can we configure application environments?
A.  1) environment.ts
    2) environment.stage.ts
    3) environment.prod.ts

11. How can we create a build specific to environment?
A. ng build --configuration = prod

12. Why budgets?
A. As applications grow in functionality, they also grow in size. The CLI allows you to set size thresholds in your configuration to ensure that parts of your application stay within size boundaries that you define.

13. How can we configure budgets?
A. Define your size boundaries in the CLI configuration file, angular.json, in a budgets section for each configured environment.

14. How can we proxying to a backend server?
A. You can use the proxying support in the webpack dev server to divert certain URLs to a backend server, by passing a file to the --proxy-config build option. For example, to divert all calls for http://localhost:4200/api to a server running on http://localhost:3000/api, take the following steps.
    1) Create a file proxy.conf.json in the projects src/ folder, next to package.json. 
    2)Add the following content to the new proxy file:
        {
            "/api": {
                "target": "http://localhost:3000",
                "secure": false
            }
        }
    3) In the CLI configuration file, angular.json, add the proxyConfig option to the serve target:
        ...
        "architect": {
        "serve": {
            "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:dev-server",
            "options": {
            "browserTarget": "your-application-name:build",
            "proxyConfig": "src/proxy.conf.json"
            },
        ...
    4) To run the dev server with this proxy configuration, call ng serve.

15. How can we add multiple proxy entries?
A.  You can proxy multiple entries to the same target by defining the configuration in JavaScript.
    Set the proxy configuration file to proxy.conf.js (instead of proxy.conf.json), and specify configuration files as in the following example.
    const PROXY_CONFIG = [
        {
            context: [
                "/my",
                "/many",
                "/endpoints",
                "/i",
                "/need",
                "/to",
                "/proxy"
            ],
            target: "http://localhost:3000",
            secure: false
        }
    ]

    module.exports = PROXY_CONFIG;

16. How can we deploy an Angular application to a production?
A. https://angular.io/guide/deployment

Angular:

17. What is Angular?
A. Angular is a Javascript framework which allows us to create reactive single page applications(SPAs).

18. What is the difference AngularJS, Angular 1, Angular 2, ..., Angular 6, Angular7?
A. Angular 1 was intially released in 2010. Angular 2 is complete re-write of Angular 1 and it was released intially in 2016. It has nothing in common with Angular 1 except the core team that developed it. If we know the Angular 1 unfortunately that knowledge will not help us much and the other other hand we also don't need to know the Angular 1.

On the other hand, The Angular 3, ..., Angular 6, Angular 7 are just Angular. And, the Angular 1 is now called as AngularJS. These two are seperate frameworks.

Angular2+ are really just incremental improvements (Bug fixes, Minor Improvements..etc), No Complete Re-Writes! The syntax is completely same for all the version of Angular.

19. How can we create new Angular application using AngularCLI?
A. ng new application-name

20. What is Typescript?
A. Typescript is a superset of Javascript. It offers more features than the Vanilla JS (e.g. Types, Classes, Interfaces). It gives the strong Typing. So, we can define a certain variable is string/number/etc, we don't do it in vanillaJS there we have a dynamic typing.

However, the Typescript doesn't run in the browser, it's compiled to Javascript in the end. And, this compilation is handled by the CLI. One of the reason why we do need the CLI and why we need project management tools like CLI.

21. How the Angular application gets loaded and started?
A. main.ts file is the entry point to the Angualr application. There we define which Module has to bootstrap first. And, in the module we define which component has to load.

E.g. main.ts -> AppModule -> AppComponent

22. What are Components?
A. The Components are the key features in Angular application. Wwe built our whole application by composing it from the couple components.

23. How can we create a Component using CLI?
A. ng generate component component-name (or)ng g c component-name

24. What are Decorators?
A. The Decorators are the Typescipt feature which allows us to enhance our classes. The Decorators are always attached with the @ sign before it's name.

25. On which package the angular core Decorators are available?
A. @angular/core

26. What @NgModule decorator does?
A. This is where we configure all the components which are belongs to the particular module.

@NgModule({
    declarations: [
        Component 1,
        Component 2,
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        FormsModule,
        HttpModule
    ],
    providers: [
        Service1,
        Service2
    ],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})

27. Difference between template and templareUrl?
A. The template property allows us to write the inline HTML code. Where as, the templateUrl property points to the view file (HTML file).

28. How many types of selectors does Angular supports?
A.  1) element 'element-name'
    2) attribute [element-name]
    3) class .element-name

29. Difference between the styles and styleUrls property?
A. The styles property allows us to define the inline css. Where as, the stylesUrls property allows us to point to the different css files.

30. What is databinding?
A. The communication between the HTML(Template) file and the Typescript code(Bussiness Logic).

31. Difference types of communication in Angular?
A.  1) String interpolation
    2) Property binding

32. What is String Interpolation?
A. If we want to output the data from the typescript code to the HTML code we use string interpolation. E.g. {{ data }}

33. What is Property binding?
A. Property data binding is one-way databinding. Property databinding is performed with the component property. Component property binding is used for communication between the parenent and the child components. E.g. [property]="data"

34. What is Event binding?
A. If we may want to trigger some Typescript code from the HTML we use this EventBinding. E.g. Lets suppose we want to trigger something in the Typescript code when we click on a button on the HTML page. E.g. (event) = "expression"

35. What is two-way data binding?
A. Combination of both property binding and event binding is called two-way databinding. 
E.g. [(ngModel)] = "data"

36. Difference between string interpolation vs property binding?
A. Whatever the thing we pass between {{}} these brackets, the string interpolation converts that value to a string. Property binding doesn't, it exact pass the same value.

37. When we use $event?
A. $event is kind of a reserved variable name, we can use this in the template when using the event binding.

38. Which module is required for the two-way data binding?
A. FormsModule

39. What are Directives?
A. Directives are instructions in the DOM.

40. Some built in directives?
A. *ngIf, *ngFor, *ngSwitch, ...etc

41. What are structuralDirectives?
A. The structural directives changes the DOM structure. E.g. *ngIf

42. *ngIf; else?
A.  <p *ngIf="serverCreated"; else noServer> Server was created
        <ng-template #noServer>
            <p>No server was created!</p>
        </ng-template>
    </p>

43. How can we style elements dynamically using ngStyle?
A. we use property binding [ngStyle]="{'background-color: getColor()}"
    camelCase: backgroundColor
    string: 'background-color'
   
   Bussiness Code:
   getColor() => this.serverStatus === "Online" ? "green" : "red";

44. How can we add or remove CSS class dynamically?
A. we use property binding [ngClass] = "{online: serverStatus === 'Online'}"

45. *ngFor or ouputting list object using *ngFor?
A. *ngFor = "let server of servers; let i = index"

46. How can we ignore creating spec files while creating custom components using angular?
A. ng g c component-name --spec false

47. How can we create nested components using angular CLI?
A. ng g c recipe-list/recipe-item

48. How can we pass data between the components?
A. Using property&event binding.

49. How can we pass data to a child component?
A. Using property binding.

50. @Input decorator use?
A. Using @Input() we can input the data from a parent component to a child component.

51. How can we assign a alias to a custom property?
A. @Input('aliasName') element: type;

52. How can we bind custom events?
A. @Output() element = new EventEmitter<type>();

53. How can we assign a alias to a custom component?
A. @Output('aliasName') element = new EventEmitter<type>();

54. What is View Encapsulation and how it works?
A. https://dzone.com/articles/what-is-viewencapsulation-in-angular

55. How many modes of encapsulation that we have in angular?
A. Native, None, Emulated
   None: Doesn't use the view encapsulation, No shadow DOM technology
   Native: Uses the shadow DOM technology, Does use the style encapsulation(It works only for the browseres which are supported shadow DOM technology )
   Emulated: No shadow DOM technology, Does use the style encapsulation

56. Local reference in Templates?
A. A local reference can be placed on any HTML tag. A local references are very a nice feature to get access to some elements in our template and then use that either directly in the template or we can pass that to typescript code.
E.g: <input type="text" #referenceName> 
    <button (click)="someFunction(referenceName)"></button>

57. How can we get access to the Template & DOM?
A. Using Template reference, @ViewChild

58. How can we get access to the Template & DOM with @ViewChild?
A. <input type="text" #referenceName> 
   @ViewChild('serverContentInput') serverContentInput;
   or
   @ViewChild(ServerContentComponent) serverContentInput; (We either can use a reference name or component type)

59. How can we project content into Components with ng-content?
A. <app-server-element>
        <p>project content through ng-content>
   </app-server-element>

   appServerElement.component.ts
   <ng-content></ng-content>

60. Explain about the Component Lifecycle?
A.  ngOnChanges - It excutes right at the start but, there after it always called after a bound input property changes (@Input) to see the new values
    ngOnit - It only called once the component is intialized, It runs after the constructor
    ngDoCheck - Called during every change detection run (on every check)
    ngAfterContentInit - Called after content(ng-content) has been projected into the view
    ngAfterContentChecked - Called every time the projected content has been checked
    ngAfterViewInit - Called after the component's view (and child views) has been intialized
    ngAfterViewChecked - Called every time the view (and child views) have been checked
    ngDestroy - Called once the component is about to be destroyed

61. How can we get access to ng-content with @ContentChild?
A. @ContentChild('referenceName') element;
